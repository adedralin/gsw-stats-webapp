I used all of the knowledge I gained from this class to create this web application. My project accesses information from a database and displays Golden State Warriors Statistics. I was able to successfully implement their roster and decked it out with CSS design. I implemented the structure of the project with jquery and handlebars.
Some problems I came up with involved working with mongoDB and syntax errors. Getting mongoDB to connect, adding the players to mongoDB, accessing the players from mongoDB were all issues. Syntax errors that caused me trouble involved handlebars and slightly confusing naming conventions for certain functions.
I worked out the problems on my own looking at past class examples, specifically the mongoDB lesson and lots of google searches. Isaiah Walker was a friend who assisted me on this project as well.
Thank you for a wonderful year professor :)
