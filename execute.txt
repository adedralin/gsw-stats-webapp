To run my project, go into the correct directory of my project on command line and run node app.js. This will start the localhost server and connect the the mongoDB database. From there, you can pull up the localhost on your browser and have access to the project. Included in the project was a file called players.js. This file allowed me to add the current Golden State Warriors roster onto mongoDB. I was able to run node players.js to achieve this provided that it follows the player schema and there is no duplicates. You do not need to run node players.js for anything other than adding things to the database.
